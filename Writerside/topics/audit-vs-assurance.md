# Audit vs. Assurance

Have you ever wondered what the difference is between an **audit** and an **assurance** engagement? These terms are often used in organizations, especially in IT, finance, and compliance, but what do they really mean? Why does understanding this difference matter?

Let us break down the concepts of **audit** and **assurance** in simple terms. We’ll explore how they work, their importance, and when they are used. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how both audits and assurance engagements help organizations stay on track and build trust.

## What is an Audit?

An **audit** is a detailed review carried out by an independent person or company to check if certain statements or claims are true. According to the [International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)](https://www.iaasb.org), an audit often focuses on financial statements. The auditor looks at the company’s financial records to see if there are any major errors or "material misstatements" that could affect how someone views the company’s performance.

When most people hear **audit**, they think of checking a company’s financial records. Can audits also apply to non-financial areas, like IT systems or business processes?


## The Internal Auditor

Not all auditors work outside of a company. Some work inside the company but still act independently. These are called **Internal Auditors**. (For more details, see the [Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)](https://www.theiia.org).) Internal Auditors are often found in larger companies, especially in industries that are heavily regulated, like banking, insurance, and financial services.

According to [Zippia.com](http://zippia.com/internal-auditor-jobs/demographics/), the top 3 industries that use Internal Auditors are Fortune 500 companies (24%), Finance (17%), and Manufacturing (7%). Outside of these areas, people might not interact with an Internal Auditor very often.

Whether they are external or internal, all auditors have a common goal: to make sure that important information, like financial reports or processes, is correct and not misleading. In other words, auditors help ensure that companies are telling the truth about their financial and business practices.

## Material Misstatement

A **material misstatement** is a big mistake or error in a company’s information, such as financial statements, that could affect someone’s decision, like whether to invest in or buy from the company.

Audits exist to check if the company’s statements are both **qualitatively** (how good they are) and **quantitatively** (how accurate the numbers are) true. If a company makes a false or misleading statement, people who rely on that information might suffer financial loss or other serious problems.

A material misstatement can happen in two ways:

- **Qualitative:** It’s about the quality or nature of the information. For example, if a company claims its product is safe without enough proof, it could mislead buyers.
- **Quantitative:** It’s about the numbers. If a company reports the wrong revenue or expense figures, it can give a false view of its financial health.

Understanding material misstatements is important because auditors look for these errors to make sure companies are being honest and accurate in what they report.

### A Simple Example

Let's say a company, "Vendor A," claims that their product is more secure than others. This is a statement that could be a **material misstatement** in three different ways:

1. **False Claim:** Vendor A could simply be lying. They might say their product is secure without taking any real steps to make it so.

2. **Not Following Their Own Rules:** Vendor A might have a security program in place, but they aren’t actually doing what their program says they should. This is a **quantitative issue**. The vendor might think they are following the rules, but in reality, they aren't. As a result, their statement about security is misleading.

3. **Misleading the Buyer:** Vendor A might have a good security program and can prove they are following it. However, they might lead the buyer to believe that their specific concerns are being addressed when they are not. This is a **qualitative issue** because it’s about how the information is presented and understood.

### The Formal Definitions

Why do we need a formal definition? Because while we've explained material misstatement in simple terms, it's important to know how experts define it and where that definition comes from.

The [International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)](https://www.iaasb.org) breaks down **material misstatement** into specific parts. Let's explore what it means for something to be **material** and how the [IAASB](https://www.iaasb.org) defines a **misstatement**.

#### Materiality

The [International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)](https://www.iaasb.org) describes **materiality** as a concept that helps auditors decide what matters most when checking information. This concept is explained in detail on page 701 in their [Handbook](https://www.iaasb.org/publications/2023-2024-handbook-international-quality-management-auditing-review-other-assurance-and-related).

In simple terms, materiality is about figuring out if a mistake or missing information is important enough to affect someone's decision. Here are the key points:

- **Context Matters:** Auditors think about who will use the information. If many people rely on this information to make decisions, it becomes more important.
- **Specific Circumstances:** Not all mistakes are equal. Auditors look at whether the mistake could change how someone sees the situation.
- **Size and Nature:** Auditors consider both the size (quantitative) and the type (qualitative) of the mistake. Even small errors can be material if they could mislead someone in an important way.

Materiality helps auditors decide which issues need to be corrected to give a true and fair view of the information.

#### Misstatement

A **misstatement** happens when something in a financial statement is incorrect or misleading. This can involve numbers, classifications, or how the information is presented. Page 107 of the [International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) Handbook](https://www.iaasb.org/publications/2023-2024-handbook-international-quality-management-auditing-review-other-assurance-and-related) explains that misstatements can occur because of mistakes (errors) or intentional actions (fraud).

Here’s what misstatements can include:

- **Incorrect Amounts:** When the numbers reported don’t match what is required.
- **Wrong Classifications:** When items are put into the wrong category.
- **Poor Presentation or Disclosure:** When information isn’t presented or explained in the right way, making it hard to understand.

Auditors look for misstatements to ensure that financial statements are true and fair. If they find anything that could mislead users, they report it so that the information can be corrected.

### Wrapping Up the “Audit”

In short, an **audit** is about making sure a company’s important statements are true and not misleading. Internal and external auditors work to find **material misstatements**, which are errors or false statements that could affect decisions made by people using that information.

A **misstatement** can happen because of an error (a mistake) or fraud (something done on purpose to mislead). During an audit, the auditor looks for these mistakes to make sure the information is fair and honest.

**Materiality** is key here. Auditors use their judgment to decide if a mistake is big enough to matter. They ask, "Would this mistake change how someone understands the information or the decisions they make?" Not all mistakes need fixing, but some can be very important.

Now that we’ve defined what an audit is, let’s explore what **assurance** means.

If all of this was to define **audit**, what is **assurance**?

## What is Assurance?

**Assurance** is different from an audit, even though both aim to build trust in information. While audits mostly focus on a company’s financial statements and are done by external parties, assurance covers a much broader range of topics. It can look at financial health, legal compliance, or other important areas to make sure information is reliable.

Assurance gives people confidence in the information they use to make decisions. It can provide either a **high** level of confidence (called "reasonable assurance") or a **moderate** level (called "limited assurance"). This flexibility makes assurance useful for many different situations.

There are three main parts of an assurance engagement:

1. **The People Involved:** There are two key players: the **practitioner** (the person performing the assurance) and the **responsible party** (the person or company being evaluated).
2. **The Level of Confidence:** Assurance can offer either **reasonable** (high) or **limited** (moderate) confidence in the information.
3. **Types of Engagements:** Assurance engagements can be either **attestation** (reviewing the company’s own evaluations) or **direct** (where the practitioner directly measures or evaluates the subject).

### The IAASB Definition of Assurance Engagement

Before we go further, let's look at how the [International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)](https://www.iaasb.org) formally defines an **Assurance Engagement**. This formal definition can be found in their [Assurance Standards Handbook](https://www.iaasb.org/publications/international-standard-assurance-engagements-isae-3000-revised-assurance-engagements-other-audits-or).

In simple terms, an **assurance engagement** is when an independent expert (the practitioner) reviews information to give confidence to the people using that information. They look at evidence to form an opinion about whether the information is accurate and trustworthy. There are two main parts to this definition:

1. **Reasonable vs. Limited Assurance:**
   - **Reasonable Assurance:** This is a high level of confidence. The practitioner thoroughly checks the information and gives their opinion on whether it meets certain standards. Think of it like a detailed check-up to ensure everything is in order.
   - **Limited Assurance:** This provides a moderate level of confidence. The practitioner performs a less detailed review, checking for anything that seems wrong. It’s more of a surface-level check, but still gives some level of comfort to users.

2. **Types of Engagements:**
   - **Attestation Engagement:** In this type, someone else (usually the company) measures or evaluates the information first. The practitioner then reviews their work to see if it meets the required criteria.
   - **Direct Engagement:** Here, the practitioner does the measuring or evaluating themselves and then presents their findings. This method gives the practitioner more control over the evaluation process.

### TechSecure Ltd. Assurance Engagement

Let’s look at an example to understand how assurance works. Imagine a company called "TechSecure Ltd." that needs to show it follows a data privacy law, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Because TechSecure Ltd. collects customer data, it must follow strict rules to keep this information safe. Here, TechSecure Ltd. is the **responsible party** because it is responsible for meeting these privacy standards.

To prove compliance, TechSecure Ltd. hires an independent firm, "DataAssure Inc." In this case, **DataAssure Inc.** is the **practitioner**. Their job is to check if TechSecure Ltd. is following the GDPR rules. DataAssure Inc. starts by reviewing how TechSecure Ltd. collects, stores, and protects customer data. They look at documents like privacy policies, security logs, and employee training records. They might even test how TechSecure Ltd. responds to customer requests to delete their data, which is an important part of GDPR compliance.

After gathering all the information, DataAssure Inc. compares TechSecure Ltd.’s practices with the GDPR rules and forms a conclusion.

- If they are providing **reasonable assurance**, they give a high level of confidence, stating whether the company meets the privacy standards.
- If they are providing **limited assurance**, their conclusion is more general. They might say, “Nothing has come to our attention that suggests TechSecure Ltd. is not compliant.” This review is less detailed than reasonable assurance.

There are two types of assurance engagements:

1. **Attestation Engagement:** Here, TechSecure Ltd. first evaluates itself. Then, DataAssure Inc. reviews those evaluations. For example, TechSecure Ltd. might claim it follows all data privacy rules, and DataAssure Inc. checks to make sure this claim is accurate.

2. **Direct Engagement:** In this type, DataAssure Inc. does all the measuring and evaluating themselves without relying on TechSecure Ltd.’s self-assessment. This often involves more detailed work.

In this example, TechSecure Ltd. is the responsible party, and DataAssure Inc. is the practitioner who evaluates the information and provides a conclusion.

Now, let’s explore the three key aspects of an assurance engagement: the people involved, the level of confidence, and the type of engagement.

### The Three Aspects of Assurance

Assurance engagements have three key aspects that help define how they work:

1. **The People Involved:** Who plays a role in the process.
2. **The Level of Confidence:** How much assurance is provided—either high (reasonable) or moderate (limited).
3. **The Type of Engagement:** The method used to measure and evaluate the subject, either attestation or direct.

In the next sections, we'll explore each of these aspects in more detail.

#### The Practitioner and the Responsible Party

In every assurance engagement, there are two key players: the **practitioner** and the **responsible party**. Each has an important role in building trust in the information being reviewed.

- **The Practitioner:** This is usually an auditor or an expert in the specific field. Their job is to gather and review enough evidence to give a clear opinion on the subject. For example, they might check if a company is following environmental laws. By thoroughly examining the information, the practitioner helps build confidence for people who rely on it, like investors, customers, or regulators.

- **The Responsible Party:** This is the person or organization that provides the information being reviewed. Most often, it’s the company itself. For instance, if a business says it meets certain standards, it becomes the responsible party by showing its compliance reports, procedures, and other documents to the practitioner.

Together, the practitioner and the responsible party are at the heart of an assurance engagement. They work together to make sure the information is accurate and trustworthy.

#### Reasonable vs. Limited Assurance

Assurance engagements come in two types: **reasonable assurance** and **limited assurance**. The main difference is how much confidence each provides based on how thoroughly the practitioner reviews the information.

- **Reasonable Assurance:** This is the more detailed of the two. The practitioner looks closely at all the information to reduce the risk of errors as much as possible. It's like a full check-up, where they dig deep into the details to make sure everything is correct. Because of this thorough examination, reasonable assurance provides a **high level of confidence** to those relying on the information.

- **Limited Assurance:** This type is less detailed. The practitioner reviews the information but doesn’t go as deep as they would in a reasonable assurance engagement. Instead, they give a general statement about whether anything seems wrong. It’s more of a surface-level check, offering a **moderate level of confidence**. While it doesn't go into as much detail, it still helps users feel that the information is likely reliable.

Both types are important, depending on how much confidence the users need.

#### Direct vs. Attestation Engagements

Assurance engagements come in two types: **attestation** and **direct**. Each serves a different purpose and involves distinct roles for the responsible party (like a company) and the practitioner (often an auditor).

- **Attestation Engagements:** In this type, the responsible party (the company) first measures or evaluates something. Then, the practitioner reviews their work to see if it is accurate. For example:
   - A company claims it meets certain safety standards.
   - The company presents its safety records.
   - The practitioner checks these records to confirm the company’s claims.

  Here, the practitioner’s main job is to **review** and **verify** the company’s work.

- **Direct Engagements:** This type requires the practitioner to be more hands-on. Instead of reviewing the company’s evaluation, the practitioner does the measuring or evaluating themselves. For example:
   - A company needs to show it follows data privacy laws.
   - The practitioner directly examines the company’s data management practices.

  In this approach, the practitioner **directly evaluates** the subject, resulting in a more thorough review.

Both types are important and provide different levels of assurance, depending on what the users need.

Here's a revised conclusion that incorporates the information about NAPE:

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between an **audit** and an **assurance engagement** is key to building trust in both financial and non-financial information. While audits focus on ensuring the accuracy of financial statements, assurance engagements offer broader coverage, providing different levels of confidence in various aspects of a business.

Both processes aim to identify and address **material misstatements**, giving users reliable information. Knowing the roles of the **practitioner** and the **responsible party**, as well as the differences between **reasonable vs. limited assurance** and **direct vs. attestation engagements**, helps clarify how these methods work to ensure credibility.

This is where **NAPE** comes into play. NAPE is an approach and technology designed to help organizations move from manual to automated and eventually to autonomous assurance. It enables the responsible party to **codify their assurance procedures** and run them as part of normal business operations. With these codified, automated, and sometimes autonomous procedures, organizations can ensure they are **24/7 audit-ready**. This constant readiness can **significantly lower the marginal cost of future audits and assurance engagements, bringing it close to zero**.

With NAPE, companies can not only streamline their compliance processes but also enhance trust and transparency, ultimately making audits and assurance engagements more efficient and effective.
