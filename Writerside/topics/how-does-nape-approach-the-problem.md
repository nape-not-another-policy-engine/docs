# How Does NAPE Approach the Problem?

To solve the challenges weâ€™ve identified, we have created a set of guiding principles. These principles explain our overall plan for tackling the obstacles and making sure our actions match our goals. The guiding policy is like a big-picture guide that helps us decide what to do and how to do it. By following these principles, we keep our approach clear, focused, and flexible, even when things change. Below, we explain the eight main principles that guide our approach to solving these problems.

## 1. Humans-Think & Computers-Compute

Create ways of working that allow humans to do what they are best at, and computers to do what they are best at.

- **Human Strengths**: Humans are good at solving complex problems, planning for the future, and making decisions based on the situation.
- **Computer Strengths** Computers are best at handling repetitive tasks, and they can manage large amounts of data quickly, allowing humans to focus on more important a complex decisions and judgements.

## 2. Clear & Formal Terminology

Words are important, and the names of capabilities or components are just as crucial as their proper functioning. It is very important that all terms used to talk about NAPE match exactly with the formal language used by industry institutions that define and teach assurance and audit processes.

## 3. Move from Manual, to Automated, and Ultimately to Autonomous

Move towards creating an autonomous system where assurance tasks operate independently, only requiring human involvement when updates to the assurance task or the things that trigger the assurance tasks are necessary.
