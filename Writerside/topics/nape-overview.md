# NAPE Overview


## What is NAPE?

NAPE is an Assurance Engine that helps you perform different types of assurance activities. It does this by:

- **Collecting** evidence in any format,
- **Evaluating** the evidence to check for specific facts,
- **Aggregating** or combining the results from many fact-checks, and
- **Establishing** whether a process or "thing" is compliant or not.

NAPE is a tool that helps people in the first line, second line, and third line of defense work more efficiently. It does this by removing the need for humans to be involved in every step of the assurance process. Instead, NAPE uses the concept of Autonomous Assurance, so humans can focus on making important decisions rather than on routine tasks.

## What Problem does NAPE Solve For?

In the world of regulated businesses, one of the biggest challenges is keeping up with all the rules and regulations. As these requirements grow, relying on old methods—like using lots of paperwork and manual labor—is no longer enough. These traditional ways don’t work well for large-scale operations, aren’t efficient, and don’t help in remembering important information over time.

One of the main reasons for this problem is that there’s a mismatch between what humans and machines are good at. Right now, companies don’t use technology enough to handle simple, repetitive tasks that computers can easily do. Instead, they keep adding more people to solve these problems, which could be done better with automation. This approach wastes resources and becomes even more problematic when employees leave, taking important knowledge with them.

Another issue is that there’s a gap between the technical work needed to ensure compliance and the knowledge of the people doing the work. Often, technical tasks are given to people who don’t fully understand the rules and requirements, leading to solutions that don’t really solve the problems. On the other hand, experts who know the rules well aren’t being trained to handle the technical side, which means they can’t work independently on these tasks.

This situation shows that companies need to rethink how they organize their work, especially using the 3 Lines of Defense model. The goal should be to let computers handle the tasks they do best, like processing and storing information, while humans focus on making strategic decisions and assessing risks. This change should also include creating a culture of ongoing, real-time compliance checks, so companies are always ready for an audit. This way, human efforts can be focused on finding new risks and managing them before they become problems, rather than just fixing issues after they arise.
