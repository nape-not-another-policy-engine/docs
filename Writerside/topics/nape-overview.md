# NAPE Overview


## What is NAPE?

NAPE is an Assurance Engine that helps you perform different types of assurance activities. It does this by:

- **Collecting** evidence in any format,
- **Evaluating** the evidence to check for specific facts,
- **Aggregating** or combining the results from many fact-checks, and
- **Establishing** whether a process or "thing" is compliant or not.

NAPE is a tool that helps people in the [first line, second line, and third lines of defense](iia-three-lines-of-defense.topic) work together more effectively. It does this by removing the need for humans to be involved in every step of the assurance process. Instead, NAPE uses the concept of Autonomous Assurance, so humans can focus on making important decisions rather than on routine tasks.

## What Problem does NAPE Solve For?

Keeping up with all the rules and regulations is one of the biggest challenges in regulated business. As these requirements grow, relying on old methods—like using lots of paperwork and manual labor—is no longer enough. These traditional methods don’t work well for large-scale operations, aren’t efficient, and don’t help in remembering important information over time.

The mismatch between what humans and machines are good at is a reason for this problem. Companies do not use enough of the correct technology to handle simple, repetitive tasks that computers can easily do. Instead, companies do one or both of two things. First, they only adopt technology that removes the handwritten paper and replaces these handwritten documents with digitized documents. Second, companies hire more people to execute simple evaluation tasks for which computers are best suited. This approach wastes resources and becomes even more problematic when employees leave, taking important knowledge with them.

Another area for improvement is a gap between the technical work needed to ensure compliance and the knowledge of the people doing the work. Often,  people who don’t fully understand the compliance or regulations requirements create solutions that don’t solve the problems. On the other hand, experts who know the rules well cannot handle the technical side, which means they cannot work autonomously on these tasks.

This situation shows that companies need to rethink how they organize their work between the technical talent and their employees who best understand the compliance and regulatory requirements. The goal should be to let computers handle the tasks they do best, like processing and storing information. Applying this level of automation allows humans to focus on making strategic decisions and assessing risks. This change should also include creating a culture of ongoing, real-time compliance checks so companies are always ready for an audit.

This way, human efforts can focus on finding new risks and managing them before they become problems rather than just fixing issues after they arise.
